To make this script more complete, here are some recommendations:
Check for other dependencies that Flask apps often use, such as:
pip3 install flask-cors for cross-origin resource sharing
pip3 install flask-sqlalchemy for database integration
pip3 install flask-wtf for form handling
Check for code editors or IDEs like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or PyCharm
Check for version control systems like Git
Check for other tools like curl, wget, or httpie for API testing
Consider adding a requirements.txt file to manage dependencies
Consider adding a venv (virtual environment) setup to isolate dependencies
Consider adding a basic Flask app template to get started with
Here's an updated script incorporating some of these recommendations:
